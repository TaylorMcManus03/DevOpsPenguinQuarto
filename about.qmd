**Dataset**

The dataset (seen below) is a well-known collection of penguin measurements and information on adult foraging penguins near Palmer Station, Antartica. This dataset is commonly used to learn/demonstrate different modeling techniques. Here, it is being used to demonstrate the capabilities of DevOps to create a website product. For an in depth look at the Penguins data set, refer to the Penguins Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) tab!

```{r}
palmerpenguins::penguins
```

Variable Specifics:

-   Species: Different species of observed penguins(Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo)

-   Island: Different islands on the Palmer Archipelago (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen)

-   Bill_length_mm: Bill length in millimeters

-   Bill_depth_mm: Bill depth in millimeters

-   Flipper_legnth_mm: Flipper length in millimeters

-   Body_mass_g: body mass in grams

-   sex: penguin sex (male or female)

-   year: year study was conducted (2007,2008,2009)

**Model**

The model used is a simple linear regression. The predictor variables are bill_length_mm, sex, and species. The response variable is body_mass_g.
