This dataset is commonly used to learn/demonstrate different modeling techniques. Here, it is being used to demonstrate the capabilities of DevOps to create a website product. For an in depth look at the Penguins data set, refer to the Penguins Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) tab!\n\n```{r}\npalmerpenguins::penguins\n```\n\nVariable Specifics:\n\n-   Species: Different species of observed penguins(Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo)\n\n-   Island: Different islands on the Palmer Archipelago (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen)\n\n-   Bill_length_mm: Bill length in millimeters\n\n-   Bill_depth_mm: Bill depth in millimeters\n\n-   Flipper_legnth_mm: Flipper length in millimeters\n\n-   Body_mass_g: body mass in grams\n\n-   sex: penguin sex (male or female)\n\n-   year: year study was conducted (2007,2008,2009)\n\n![](images/paste-5095527C.png)\n\n**Model**\n\nThe model used is a simple linear regression. The predictor variables are bill_length_mm, sex, and species. The response variable is body_mass_g.\n\n**Meet the Author**\n\nHi! My name is Taylor McManus. I am from Columbia, MD and I am currently a Junior at the US Air Force Academy (USAFA). This project was done as an introductory into DevOps in accordance with the USAFA Math 378 Course.\n\n![](images/paste-68584221.png){width=\"362\"}\n\n**References**\n\nThis website was created based on the labs in the chapters 1-6 of Alex K. Golds *DevOps for Data Science* textbook. Additionally, substantial help was provided by ChatGPT, Dr. Jessica Hauschild, and Dr. Brianna Hitt.
