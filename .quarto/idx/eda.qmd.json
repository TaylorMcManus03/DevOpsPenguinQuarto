For Adelie penguins, there seems to be bill_length_mm and body_mass_g values on the lower end suggesting that the Adelie species is typically a smaller type of penguin. The Chinstrap seems to demonstrate longer bill_length_mm but similar body_mass_g meaning that these penguins are similar size to Adelie penguins but with a proportionally longer bill. Finally, the Gentoo penguins show generally higher body_mass_g than both species and bill_length_mm similar to the Chinstrap species. This tells us that likely these are the biggest penguin species of thr three and have bill legnths proportionally closer to the Adelie penguins.\n\n## Penguin Size vs Mass by Sex\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\n#| message: false \n#| warning: false\n\ndf_new<-df[complete.cases(df$sex), ]\ndf_new %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = sex)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n```\nThe line of best fit for the two sexes are relatively parallel demonstrating that the overall proportion of bill_length_mm and body_mass_g have similar results between male and female penguins. Looking at the individual data points, it seems that, on the extreme ends of body_mass_g, males tend to lie in the high zone and females in the low. In the center of the body_mass_g range, there is a good mix. This demonstrates that sex may not be the only delineating factor in correlated body_mass_g. As seen above, the interplay of species also has a big play in the mass of a penguin. In terms of bill_length_mm, there seems to be an even spread across the range for both sexes. Overall, this graph shows a weaker relationship between bill_length_mm and body_mass_g, and sex in comparison to the relationship show above with bill_length_mm and body_mass_g, and sex.\n\n## Data Processing\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\n#| message: false \ndf %>%\n  group_by(species, sex) %>%\n  summarise(\n    across(\n        ends_with(\"mm\") | ends_with(\"g\"),\n      \\(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)\n      )\n    ) %>%\n  dplyr::collect() %>%\n  knitr::kable()\n```\n\n<!--\n# ```{r}\n# #connecting to the database\n# library(dbplyr)\n# con <- DBI::dbConnect(\n#   duckdb::duckdb(), \n#   dbdir = \"my-db.duckdb\"\n#   )\n# ```\n# \n# ```{r}\n# DBI::dbWriteTable(con, \"penguins\", palmerpenguins::penguins)\n# df <- dplyr::tbl(con, \"penguins\")\n# ```\n# \n# ```{r}\n# req <- httr2::request(\"http://127.0.0.1:8080/predict\") |>\n#   httr2::req_body_json(\n#     list(\n#       list(\n#         \"bill_length_mm\" = 0,\n#         \"species_Chinstrap\" = FALSE,\n#         \"species_Gentoo\" = FALSE,\n#         \"sex_male\" = FALSE\n#       )\n#     )\n#   ) |>\n#   httr2::req_perform()\n# res <- httr2::resp_body_json(req)$predict[[1]]\n# ```\n# \n# ```{r}\n# DBI::dbDisconnect(con)\n```\n-->\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"eda.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.189","editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title":"Penguins Exploratory Data Analysis"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
